## Image assets

### Controllers

Most controller images are from Pineapple Graphics (see [Sublicenses](#sublicenses)). A small drop shadow was added to each controller, and the controllers are scaled roughly based on their actual physical sizes (6 px = 1 mm) and placed on a 1560x960 transparent canvas.

### Header images

Most header logos are from Dan Patrick (see [Sublicenses](#sublicenses)). To get the SVGs to display properly in Emulation Station, I had to edit most of them with Inkscape. Generally they had to be flattened and re-saved. If any paths displayed incorrectly when selecting all layers and objects and then flattening, it helped to select each path (e.g. each letter or shape) individually and perform a Path->Union (âŒ˜ + on macOS) operation on it, and then retry flattening all paths, group them, and save.
